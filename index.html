            <p>This is an educational website which explains the history of human mortuary behaviour and offers an explanation as to why it might have occurred in human history.</p>
            <p>I decided to create this website as a shortened explanation of my masters thesis. I started asking questions about human behaviour as a spring board from my interest in religion. I wanted to find a scientific explanation as to why religion may have come about in it's first instance, at the birthplace of human evolution. Studying archaeology helped me toward this goal, and evolutionary psychology even further. Finding religion in the archaeological record is notoriously difficult, finding the physical remains of a tangible concept. Instead I started to look at the question from a different angle. What can the bones and remains of ancient species of humans tell us about why certains behaviours became prominent within our species. By looking at mortuary behaviour (any interactions humans have with dead bodies), we can infer from a evolutioanry perspective why these practices may have come about.</p>
